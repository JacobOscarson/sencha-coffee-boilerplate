Sencha Touch /w CoffeeScript boilerplate
----------------------------------------

This repository is for now mostly a small demonstration on how to use
[CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and the
[Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) mobile web-apps
framework together.

It was originally described in [this
blogpost](http://www.plexical.com/blog/2011/05/27/green-tea-mixed-with-coffee/
).

For instructions on how to install install CoffeeScript, see
[here](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#installation ). When
you're done, the most comfortable way to experiment is just to run the
CoffeeScript compiler in the top directory in watch mode:

    $ coffee --watch

Have fun!
